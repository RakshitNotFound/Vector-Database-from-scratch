Vector Database From Scratch (Go)A lightweight, in-memory vector database implemented in Go. This project demonstrates the core principles of high-dimensional data retrieval using Cosine Similarity to find the nearest neighbors for a given query vector.FeaturesIn-Memory Storage: Efficiently stores vectors along with associated metadata.Cosine Similarity: Uses mathematical dot products and norms to calculate the angular distance between vectors.Top-K Search: Returns the most relevant results sorted by their similarity score.How it WorksThe database represents data as vectors (arrays of numbers). When a query is made, the system performs a linear search across all stored vectors:Dot Product: It calculates the sum of the products of corresponding components.Normalization: It calculates the magnitude (norm) of both the query and the stored vectors.Similarity Score: It applies the Cosine Similarity formula:$$Similarity = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\| \|B\|}$$Ranking: The results are sorted in descending order, where a score closer to 1.0 indicates higher similarity.Technical ImplementationLanguage: Go (Golang)Data Structures: * Vector: Struct containing ID, float32 values, and metadata.VectorDB: A struct managing a slice of Vectors.Sorting: Utilizes Go's sort.Slice for efficient ranking of results based on float64 similarity scores.
